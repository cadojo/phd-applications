My first simulation study at NASA's Flight Sciences Lab produced
puzzling results. Unexpected bifurcations had emerged in the dispersed
spacecraft trajectories, and with hundreds of models integrated by
thousands of engineers, the cause was unclear. I have since learned to
consult previous studies, and isolate models to explain emergent
dynamical effects. Now, I hope to build and execute similar simulation
studies to explain and predict observations of galaxy & stellar
evolution, the universe's large-scale structure, and other astrophysical
phenomena.
