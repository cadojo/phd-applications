I am exploring general astrophysical concepts through the 
[Big Orange Book](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/an-introduction-to-modern-astrophysics), and galactic dynamics 
specifically through Dr. Body's online [textbook](https://galaxiesbook.org) 
draft. Regardless of the path of my research career, I look forward to 
exploring concepts through computation, and sharing what I learn with 
others through open source scientific software.
