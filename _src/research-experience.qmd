My graduate research assistant experience under Dr. Dave Akin brought me 
into the weeds of constrained, performant software development. My final
aerospace engineering course, Interplanetary Navigation & 
Guidance with Mr. Brent Barbee, introduced me to computational discovery
and interdisciplinary research.

The University of Maryland's Space Systems Lab
([SSL](https://ssl.umd.edu)) develops and maintains an 8DOF serial manipulator 
([Ranger](https://ssl.umd.edu/ranger)) for satellite servicing and dexterous 
manipulation research. I independently developed the final 
components of the lab's core robot software following a total rewrite: 
interfaces (`C++` templates) and implementations for all kinematic solvers 
and Cartesian controllers. One kinematic
[solver's](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-4563(200009)17:9%3C453::AID-ROB1%3E3.0.CO;2-A)
implementation introduced performance problems: the computation required 
several intermediate-Jacobian
solutions, which I initially solved-for iteratively. After contributing the 
required [fixes](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl/pull/72), 
I used Julia's [`Symbolics.jl`](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/)
to print analytical intermediate-Jacobian solutions to performant 
non-allocating `C++` functions; as a result, each intermediate-Jacobian 
solve's performance improved by a factor of two. This experience at SSL,
and others, taught me how to write performant software for high-speed 
computations. Graduate course projects, under Mr. Barbee's guidance, showed
me how computation extends to physical discovery.

For my final M.S. course's term project, I replicated halo orbit
and invariant manifold computations as summarized by Megan Rund's 
[thesis](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1853/) on low-cost
interplanetary transfer techniques. Intersections of manifolds can provide 
low-cost transfers across the solar system; NASA has labeled them 
[_Interplanetary Superhighways_](https://dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:2014/51594).
I [released](https://github.com/cadojo/CR3BP-Manifold-Research) 
initial conditions for over 130k periodic orbits near planets within our 
solar system, and published orbit and manifold solver codes to open source 
[Julia packages](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl).



<!-- 
Literature presented several flavors of the iterative halo orbit solver 
with little guidance on which flavor to choose; I found one of the flavors
to be compatible with three-dimensional orbits, while the other flavor was 
exclusively capable of solving for two-dimensional orbits.   -->
