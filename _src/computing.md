As my engineering research and professional interests shifted toward
nonlinear dynamics, computation quickly became my most productive tool.
[Julia's](https://julialang.org) open-source modeling, simulation, and
symbolic manipulation packages were particularly helpful for exploring
smaller dynamical systems' structure and solutions. I am proud to have
brought several astrophysical models into Julia's ecosystem with
[`AstrodynamicalModels.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/AstrodynamicalModels.jl)
and
[`GalacticPotentials.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/GalacticPotentials.jl);
after professionally developing similar capabilities for the Artemis
Program, I received a Superior Achievement Award from the NASA Johnson
Space Center Director.

As a flight dynamics engineer, I have characterized and improved
integrated spacecraft performance with numerical simulations.
These simulations modeled all known dynamical effects,
including flexible structure & separation dynamics, propellant slosh, and sensor
noise. I routinely executed tens of thousands of Monte Carlo simulations to
determine the vehicle performance's sensitivity to individually modified models.
One such study found control parameter values which substantially improved vehicle
performance; I independently documented the new parameters' macro-dynamical
effects with more than 150 pages of technical reports.
