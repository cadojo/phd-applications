My first set of simulation results at NASA
were initially puzzling. Unexpected bifurcations had 
emerged from the dispersed vehicle trajectories, and with hundreds 
of models by thousands of engineers integrated into the code,
I was unsure where to begin my investigation. I soon
learned to pull hints from (internal) flight dynamics reports,
and use linear & nonlinear analysis methods to find the models 
responsible for the macro-dynamical effects.
