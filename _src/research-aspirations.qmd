Before my graduate astrodynamics coursework, I had not considered 
a career in astrophysics research. I was delighted to learn that 
astrophysical phenomena are studied in ways which align with my 
current technical skill set: dynamical analysis and scientific software 
development. Since graduation, I have missed formally learning 
about the universe through coursework and computation. I am 
eager to grow as a physicist, and work to advance discovery
alongside scientists and research engineers.
