In 2021, I released all of my astrodynamics research, and much of the 
functionality covered by my astrodynamics coursework, in a single Julia
package: 
[`GeneralAstrodynamics.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl). 
I have since corrected common beginner mistakes, such as over-relying on 
multiple dispatch. Throughout this effort, I have paused to develop
new astrodynamics packages; of these, I have 
found [`SPICEKernels.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl) to be 
the most useful. Professionally, scientific software has been critical 
to my role as an integrated GN&C analyst in the Artemis Program. I have 
developed several internal Python packages to assist with nonlinear 
analysis and verification, including a novel 6DOF kinematics simulator.

All of the scientific software I write personally is published on GitHub 
under the username [`@cadojo`](https://github.com/cadojo), and is
linked-to and summarized by my personal website: 
[`loopy.codes`](https://loopy.codes/packages). 
I have enjoyed applying scientific software to human space exploration
projects, and I am excited to apply these skills to physical discovery.
