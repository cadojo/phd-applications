I published all of my astrodynamics research codes as a series of Julia
[packages](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl), and I have 
enjoyed developing other scientific convenience packages in spare time, such 
as [`SPICEKernels.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl).
All my open source software can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo) and
my personal website: [`loopy.codes`](https://loopy.codes/packages). 
Professionally, scientific software has been critical 
to my role as an integrated GN&C analyst in the Artemis Program. 
I routinely execute massively parallel monte-carlo simulations on NASA 
HPC clusters, and analyze that data to better understand emergent dynamical
conditions encountered during simulated atmospheric flight; in 2022, I 
independently wrote over 150 pages of technical reports which documented 
several such investigations. While I have enjoyed contributing to human
space exploration projects, and I am eager to apply similar computational 
investigations to open, scientific research.
