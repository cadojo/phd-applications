All of my astrodynamics research codes are available as a series of Julia
[packages](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl). I have 
enjoyed developing other scientific convenience packages in spare time, such 
as [`SPICEKernels.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl).
My open source software projects are hosted at
[`github.com/cadojo`](https://github.com/cadojo), 
and described on my personal website: [`loopy.codes`](https://loopy.codes/packages). 
Professionally, scientific software has been critical 
to my role as an integrated GN&C analyst in NASA's Artemis Program. 
I have used linear analysis, model reduction, and parameter sweeps to explain & improve
results in tens of thousands of monte-carlo simulations. In 2022, I 
wrote over 150 pages of technical reports which documented 
such investigations. While I have enjoyed contributing to human
space exploration projects, and I am eager to apply similar computational 
investigations to scientific research.
