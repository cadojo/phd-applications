I led software development in Dr. Dave Akin's Space Systems Lab (SSL)
for four years cumulatively as an undergraduate student, and as a
graduate Dean's Fellowship recipient and research assistant. SSL's
primary application, an 8DOF dexterous manipulator known as Ranger,
required consistently fast and precise control loops. As I developed
kinematic solvers and Cartesian controllers for Ranger, I learned
techniques for improving mathematical software: parallelism for reducing
jitter, in-place calculations for avoiding allocation, and careful
benchmark design for algorithm selection. I presented benchmarks for one
such selection in a research paper: analytical Jacobian codes, generated
with my personal contributions to Julia's `Symbolics.jl`, which halved
computation time relative to iterative methods. After applying these
techniques, Ranger successfully completed spacecraft manipulation demos,
and I developed fluency in scientific software development.
