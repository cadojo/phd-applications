Under Dr. Dave Akin's advisement, I led Space Systems Lab (SSL) software
development as an undergraduate research assistant, as a graduate Dean's
Fellowship recipient and research assistant. SSL's primary application,
an 8DOF dexterous manipulator known as Ranger, required consistently
fast and precise control loops. As I developed kinematic solvers and
Cartesian controllers for Ranger, I learned techniques for improving
mathematical software: parallelism for reducing jitter, in-place
calculations for removing memory allocation bottlenecks, and careful
benchmark design for algorithm selection. My final research paper
presented benchmarks for one such selection: analytical Jacobian codes,
generated with my personal contributions to Julia's `Symbolics.jl`,
which halved computation time relative to standard iterative methods.
With these techniques applied, Ranger successfully completed spacecraft
manipulation demos, and I developed fluency in mathematical software
development.
