In my three years at NASA, I have come to understand the space
industry's shrinking — and astronomy's growing — need for computational
methods. My interest in space science has long been fueled by
astronomers' social media posts, and popular science magazines. I have
been thrilled to recently learn that my technical skill-set may serve
the cause of discovery through computational astronomy & astrophysics
research.
