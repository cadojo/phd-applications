After three years at NASA, I have come to understand the space
industry's shrinking — and astronomy's growing — need for computational
methods. Astronomers' social media posts and popular science literature have
long fueled my interested in space science, so I have
been thrilled to learn that my technical skill-set can serve computational
astronomy & astrophysics research.
