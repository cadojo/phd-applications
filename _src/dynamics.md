I had always enjoyed courses related to dynamical systems, but I thrived
when my graduate astrodynamics coursework encouraged computational
methods. My Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance term project replicated
halo orbit and invariant manifold solvers, as summarized by Megan Rund's
[thesis](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1853/). Multiple
differential correction flavors are documented in literature, but I
found no guidance for algorithm selection. My final paper mapped desired
orbit characteristics to compatible solvers, announced several
open-source Julia
[packages](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl), and
presented over 130k [initial
conditions](https://github.com/cadojo/CR3BP-Manifold-Research) for
periodic orbits. I was thrilled to find true low-energy trajectories
throughout our solar system with laptop-scale computation. After
presenting this work at [JuliaCon
2021](https://youtu.be/WnvKaUsGv8w?si=GaO9QXEtBId9USVm), I was invited
to join the `JuliaSpace` organization to collaborate with other
astrodynamics researchers across the world, including Germany and Japan.
