I am an aerospace engineer and scientific software developer 
who is passionate about computational dynamics. I have been 
fortunate to have had the opportunity to exercise this 
background to expand human space exploration at NASA. 
Now, I aspire to grow as a computational physicist, and 
expand astrophysical discovery through research.
