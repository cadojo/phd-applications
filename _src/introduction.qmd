I am an aerospace engineer and scientific software developer 
who is passionate about computational dynamics. I have been 
fortunate to have had the opportunity to exercise this 
background in support of human space exploration projects 
at NASA. I aspire to learn as much as possible about the 
physical world, and work to expand our knowledge through
astrophysical dynamics research.
