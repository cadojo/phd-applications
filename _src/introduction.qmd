I am an aerospace engineer and scientific software developer 
who is passionate about computational dynamics. My aerospace 
dynamics & controls research emphasized computation, and I 
have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to exercise 
this background as an integrated GN&C analyst to expand 
human space exploration at NASA. Now, I aspire to grow as a 
computational physicist, and expand astrophysical discovery 
through computational research.
