Thank you for reading! The table below provides all of the letters I am writing for 
fall 2024 astrophysics PhD programs. After my positive experiences simulating astrodynamical
systems, and atmospheric flight dynamics, I am interested in applying computation to 
astrophysical simulations. After scanning academic papers and university research websites,
I am most interested in astrophysical research relating to cosmology, galactic dynamics,
and accretion/ablation dynamics; this list of dynamical contexts will almost certainly change
as I learn more about the field. 

Between October 2023 and January 2024, I will be applying to fellowships and graduate 
programs which emphasize computation. I welcome all feedback in the letters linked below.
Thank you so much for supporting me in this career transition!
