Thank you for reading! The table below provides all of the letters I am writing for 
fall 2024 astrophysics PhD programs. After my positive experiences simulating astrodynamical
systems, and atmospheric flight dynamics, I am interested in applying computation to 
astrophysical simulations. Between October 2023 and January 2024, I will be applying 
to fellowships and graduate programs which emphasize computation.

My resume can be found at [`resume.loopy.codes`](https://resume.loopy.codes). 
For reference all of my statement of purpose drafts are available in the table 
below; fields in the left-most column link to each respective letter. 
**At this time, only [MIT's Statement of Purpose](/letters/mit/statement-of-purpose) 
is finished**. All other letters will be completed soon. Thank you for supporting me in this career transition!
