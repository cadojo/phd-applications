    "text": "Thank you for reading! The table below provides all of the letters I am writing for fall 2024 astrophysics PhD programs. After my positive experiences simulating astrodynamical systems, and atmospheric flight dynamics, I am interested in applying computation to astrophysical simulations. After scanning academic papers and university research websites, I am most interested in astrophysical research relating to cosmology, galactic dynamics, and accretion/ablation dynamics; this list of dynamical contexts will almost certainly change as I learn more about the field.\nBetween October 2023 and January 2024, I will be applying to fellowships and graduate programs which emphasize computation. I welcome all feedback in the letters linked below. Thank you so much for supporting me in this career transition!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\n\n\nOrganization\n\n\nModified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\n\nMIT Department of Physics\n\n\n10/21/23, 1:31:36 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Introduction\nI am an aerospace engineer and scientific software developer who is passionate about computational dynamics. I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to exercise this background to expand human space exploration at NASA. Now, I aspire to grow as a computational physicist, and expand astrophysical discovery through research.\nAs I continue to learn about open topics in astrophysics research, I am particularly drawn to research areas relating to galactic dynamics, large scale structure formation, and gravitational wave dynamics. I hope to be considered for graduate advisement by Dr. Vogelsberger, Dr. Necib, and Dr. Hughes. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to the MIT Department of Physics’ PhD program; thank you for your consideration.\n\n\nResearch Experience\nMy graduate research assistant experience under Dr. Dave Akin brought me into the weeds of constrained, performant software development. My final aerospace engineering course, Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance with Mr. Brent Barbee, introduced me to computational discovery and interdisciplinary research.\nThe University of Maryland’s Space Systems Lab (SSL) develops and maintains an 8DOF serial manipulator (Ranger) for satellite servicing and dexterous manipulation research. I independently developed the final components of the lab’s core robot software following a total rewrite: interfaces (C++ templates) and implementations for all kinematic solvers and Cartesian controllers. One kinematic solver’s implementation introduced performance problems: the computation required several intermediate-Jacobian solutions, which I initially solved-for iteratively. After contributing the required fixes, I used Julia’s Symbolics.jl to print analytical intermediate-Jacobian solutions to performant non-allocating C++ functions; as a result, each intermediate-Jacobian solve’s performance improved by a factor of two. This experience at SSL, and others, taught me how to write performant software for high-speed computations. Graduate course projects, under Mr. Barbee’s guidance, showed me how computation extends to physical discovery.\nFor my final M.S. course’s term project, I replicated halo orbit and invariant manifold computations as summarized by Megan Rund’s thesis on low-cost interplanetary transfer techniques. Intersections of manifolds can provide low-cost transfers across the solar system; NASA has labeled them Interplanetary Superhighways. I released initial conditions for over 130k periodic orbits near planets within our solar system, and published orbit and manifold solver codes to open source Julia packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific Computing\nAll of the scientific software I write is published on GitHub under the username @cadojo, and is linked-to and summarized at my personal website: loopy.codes.\n\n\nResearch Aspirations\n\n\nFuture Plans"
