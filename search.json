    "text": "Publication History\nAs a graduate aerospace engineering student, I wrote two academic papers which are pending publication: a paper on robot kinematics solvers, and a paper on differential correction methods in three-body astrodynamics contexts.\nAs a graduate student researcher in the Space Systems Lab, I developed novel code generation tools which produced analytical Jacobian and forward-kinematics solutions for lab robots. I presented these codes in an academic paper, along with benchmarks showing a \\(2\\times\\) performance improvement relative to standard iterative solvers for low-DOF arms. I worked with my advisor, Dr. Dave Akin, to submit the paper for consideration for an upcoming AIAA Conference. We withdrew the paper after the research funding export control review process passed the conference submission deadline.\nAs a graduate astrodynamics (Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance) student, I replicated elements of Megan Rund’s thesis on manifold-based interplanetary transfer designs within the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem. Specifically, I implemented a differential correction algorithm for finding periodic orbits within the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, and I computed manifolds about halo orbits for low-cost interplanetary transfer designs; a bug in the manifold computations was corrected post-graduation. After finding three flavors of the same differential correction algorithm in literature — each flavor used different state variables for the correction term — I presented a novel decision tree in my final term paper. This decision tree provided guidance for selecting each particular algorithmic flavor, depending on the desired halo orbit characteristics. This paper is publicly available on GitHub. Due to my employment with the federal government, the paper must be reviewed by my employer before it can be submitted for publication.\n\n\nOpen Source Software\nI have released over one dozen open-source scientific software packages. I am particularly active in the All are hosted on my GitHub profile, @cadojo. My personal website, loopy.codes, lists and summarizes each open-source project. My aerospace engineering research benefitted greatly from open-source scientific software. I believe open-source scientific software can similarly benefit the computational astrophysics research I aspire to undertake as a graduate physics researcher."

    "text": "Summary of Objectives\nMy first simulation study at NASA’s Flight Sciences Lab produced puzzling results. Unexpected bifurcations had emerged in the dispersed spacecraft trajectories, and with hundreds of models integrated by thousands of engineers, the cause was unclear. I have since learned to consult previous studies, and isolate models to explain emergent dynamical effects. Now, I hope to design and execute large-scale simulations to explain and predict observations of galaxy & stellar evolution, the universe’s large-scale structure, and other astrophysical phenomena.\nAstrophysical simulations produce domain-specific results, but their development demands expertise across many computational and scientific disciplines. With cultivated expertise in computational methods, including within the NBody Shop, UW is uniquely prepared to drive this moment in astronomy and train the next generation of researchers. I hope you will consider me for admission to this training as part of the UW Department of Astronomy’s Doctoral Program. My experience across multiple disciplines, including scientific software development and nonlinear dynamics, has prepared me for the interdisciplinary work of computational astrophysics research.\n\n\nRobotics Research\nI led software development in Dr. Dave Akin’s Space Systems Lab (SSL) for four years cumulatively as an undergraduate student, and as a graduate Dean’s Fellowship recipient and research assistant. SSL’s primary application, an 8DOF dexterous manipulator known as Ranger, required consistently fast and precise control loops. As I developed kinematic solvers and Cartesian controllers for Ranger, I learned techniques for improving mathematical software: parallelism for reducing jitter, in-place calculations for avoiding allocation, and careful benchmark design for algorithm selection. I presented benchmarks for one such selection in a research paper: analytical Jacobian codes, generated with my personal contributions to Julia’s Symbolics.jl, which halved computation time relative to iterative methods. After applying these techniques, Ranger successfully completed spacecraft manipulation demos, and I developed fluency in scientific software development.\n\n\nDynamics Research\nI had always enjoyed courses related to dynamical systems, but I thrived when my graduate astrodynamics coursework encouraged computational methods. My Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance term project replicated halo orbit and invariant manifold solvers, as summarized by Megan Rund’s thesis. Multiple differential correction flavors are documented in literature, but I found no guidance for algorithm selection. My final paper mapped desired orbit characteristics to compatible solvers, announced several open-source Julia packages, and presented over 130k initial conditions for periodic orbits. I was thrilled to find true low-energy trajectories throughout our solar system with laptop-scale computation. After presenting this work at JuliaCon 2021, I was invited to join the JuliaSpace organization to collaborate with other astrodynamics researchers across the world, including Germany and Japan.\n\n\n\nNumerical Simulations\nAs my engineering research and professional interests shifted toward nonlinear dynamics, computation quickly became my most productive tool. Julia’s open-source modeling, simulation, and symbolic manipulation packages were particularly helpful for exploring smaller dynamical systems’ structure and solutions. I am proud to have brought several astrophysical models into Julia’s ecosystem with AstrodynamicalModels.jl and GalacticPotentials.jl; after professionally developing similar capabilities for the Artemis Program, I received a Superior Achievement Award from the NASA Johnson Space Center Director.\nAs a flight dynamics engineer, I have characterized and improved integrated spacecraft performance with numerical simulations. These simulations modeled all known dynamical effects, including flexible structure & separation dynamics, propellant slosh, and sensor noise. I routinely executed tens of thousands of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the vehicle performance’s sensitivity to individually modified models. One such study found control parameter values which substantially improved vehicle performance; I independently documented the new parameters’ macro-dynamical effects with more than 150 pages of technical reports.\n\n\nResearch Aspirations\nAfter three years at NASA, I have come to understand the space industry’s shrinking — and astronomy’s growing — need for computational methods. Astronomers’ social media posts and popular science literature have long fueled my interested in space science, so I have been thrilled to learn that my technical skill-set can serve computational astronomy & astrophysics research.\nMy flight dynamics simulations within NASA echo elements of Dr. Quinn’s, Dr. McQuinn’s, and Dr. Shipp’s simulation studies: both explore macro-dynamical consequences of known or hypothesized physical laws. After conducting dynamical sensitivity studies as an engineer, I have been encouraged to find similar methods used in astrophysics research, such as Dr. Faerman’s characterization during his tenure at The Hebrew University. I hope to discuss similar such studies with my advisor, and quantify other dynamical modes, i.e. galaxy evolution’s sensitivity to radiation pressure and stellar winds, gas flows, nearby galaxy clusters, and the epoch of reionization.\nI am also interested in exploring novel computational methods to advance the scalability of modern astrophysical simulations, such as the ChaNGa simulation project’s optimized tree-based gravity solver. In addition to numerical algorithms, many scientific machine learning tools are being developed within the Julia Programming Language community; these tools helped to propel my graduate astrodynamics & robotics research. If my advisor found such approaches promising for astronomy, I would welcome opportunities to improve and integrate scientific machine learning capabilities with N-Body Shop codes.\n\n\nFuture Aspirations\nWith leaders in computational research, physics, mathematics, and other technical fields, the University of Washington is uniquely suited to drive this moment in astronomy. I hope to have the opportunity to learn from this expertise as a Doctoral student in UW’s Department of Astronomy. Thank you for your consideration."

I am interested in exploring how Julia’s revolutionary modeling and simulation codes may accelerate astrophysical simulations and aid projects such as Dr. Millholland’s data-driven approach to stellar formation modeling. If my advisor found similar ideas promising, I would welcome cross-department collaborations in the pursuit of novel science.\n\n\nFuture Aspirations\nWith leaders in computational research, physics, mathematics, and so many other technical fields, MIT is uniquely suited to drive this moment of interdiscplinary need in astronomy.
