# Introduction

{{< include /_src/introduction.qmd >}}

As I continue to learn about open topics in astrophysics research,
I am particularly drawn to research areas relating to galactic 
dynamics, large scale structure formation, and gravitational wave
dynamics. I hope to be considered for graduate advisement by 
__Dr. Vogelsberger__, __Dr. Necib__, and __Dr. Hughes__. 
I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to the MIT Department 
of Physics' PhD program; thank you for your consideration.
