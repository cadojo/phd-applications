# Introduction

{{< include /_src/introduction.qmd >}}

I am particularly interested in topics relating to galactic 
dynamics, large scale structure formation, and stellar formation. 
I hope to be considered for graduate advisement by 
[Dr. Vogelsberger](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/), 
[Dr. Necib](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/lina-necib/), and 
[Dr. Frebel](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/anna-frebel/). 
I am eager to apply the skills I have gained through computational research, 
scientific software development, and large-scale dynamical studies, 
to astrophysics research projects within MIT's Department of Physics, and the
Kavli Institute.

# Research Aspirations

I believe that my simulation studies at NASA echo MIT's massive 
astrophysical simulation projects, i.e. [`IllustrisTNG`](https://www.tng-project.org).
While different in scope and purpose, both aim to study emergent dynamical 
consequences of known or hypothesized physical laws. At NASA, I frequently disable specific
dynamical models to determine their effect on simulated vehicle trajectories. 
I have been encouraged to find similar methods used in astrophysics research,
such as Josh Borrow's [characterization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03255.pdf) of the 
impact of the epoch of reionization on simulated galactic formation. As an astrophysics 
student, I hope to discuss similar such studies with my advisor, and work to characterize 
the sensitivity of astrophysical phenomena to other dynamical effects, i.e. galaxy formation's
sensitivity to rates of stellar formation and $\text{Lyman-}\alpha$ radiation dynamics. 

In my view, cosmological & galactic simulation codes have two distinct roles: 
fast implementations for research, and convenient interfaces for education. 
Fitting my graduate astrodynamics coursework into convenient open source software 
was an incredibly productive educational exercise, and I plan to similarly 
explore my astrophysics coursework through software. When appropriate, I hope to publish
astrophysics codes to help undergraduate and early-graduate students learn 
foundational concepts through computational exploration. Julia, and its package ecosystem,
provide excellent tools for such a computational playground. MIT's 
[Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu) is revolutionizing scientific computing, and I am 
interested in applying their novel codes to astrophysical contexts. Might exploratory 
studies with [Dr. Rackauckas'](https://chrisrackauckas.com) unique surrogate 
modeling & differentiable simulation codes help scope future high-fidelity 
simulation studies? If an advisor found similar ideas promising, I would welcome such 
interdisciplinary research opportunities. I have been delighted to find astrophysics
research methods which align with my technical skill set: dynamical analysis and 
scientific computing. I look forward to learning more about our universe, and growing
new technical skills as a scientist.

I hope I have the opportunity to learn from MIT's excellent instructors and researchers.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
