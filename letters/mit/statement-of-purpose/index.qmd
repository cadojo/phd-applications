# Introduction 

{{< include /_src/introduction.qmd >}}

As I continue to learn about open topics in astrophysics research,
I am particularly drawn to research areas relating to galactic 
dynamics, large scale structure formation, and gravitational wave
dynamics. I hope to be considered for graduate advisement by 
Dr. Vogelsberger, Dr. Necib, and Dr. Hughes. I believe my research
experience, and scientific software development experience, would 
quickly enable productive contributions to their research teams.
I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to the MIT Department
of Physics' PhD program; thank you for your time and consideration.
