title: Personal Statement
description: MIT Department of Physics

This statement addresses two separate topics: my publication history, and my
work within the open-source scientific software community.

As a graduate aerospace engineering student, I wrote academic papers for course
projects, and for my research contributions in the Space Systems Lab. Professor
Barbee, my Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance course instructor, encouraged
me to submit my term paper for publication.
