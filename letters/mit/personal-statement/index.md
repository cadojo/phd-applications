# Publication History

As a graduate aerospace engineering student, I wrote two academic papers
which are pending publication: a paper on robot kinematics solvers, and
a paper on differential correction methods in three-body astrodynamics
contexts.

As a graduate student researcher in the Space Systems Lab, I developed
novel code generation tools which produced analytical Jacobian and
forward-kinematics solutions for lab robots. I presented these codes in
an academic paper, along with benchmarks showing a $2\times$ performance
improvement relative to standard iterative solvers for low-DOF arms. I
worked with my advisor, Dr. Dave Akin, to submit the paper for
consideration for an upcoming AIAA Conference. We withdrew the paper
after the research funding export control review process passed the
conference submission deadline.

As a graduate astrodynamics (Interplanetary Navigation & Guidance)
student, I replicated elements of Megan Rund's
[thesis](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1853/) on
manifold-based interplanetary transfer designs within the Circular
Restricted Three Body Problem. Specifically, I implemented a
differential correction algorithm for finding periodic orbits within the
Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, and I computed manifolds about
halo orbits for low-cost interplanetary transfer designs; a bug in the
manifold computations was corrected post-graduation. After finding three
flavors of the same differential correction algorithm in literature —
each flavor used different state variables for the correction term — I
presented a novel decision tree in my final term paper. This decision
tree provided guidance for selecting each particular algorithmic flavor,
depending on the desired halo orbit characteristics. This paper is
publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo/CR3BP-Manifold-Research/blob/main/papers/manifold-transfers/tex/Carpinelli_Manifold_Transfers.pdf).
Due to my employment with the federal
government, the paper must be reviewed by my employer before it can be
submitted for publication.

# Open Source Software

I have released over one dozen open-source scientific software packages. I am
particularly active in the
All are hosted on my GitHub profile, [`@cadojo`](https://github.com/cadojo).
My personal website, [`loopy.codes`](https://loopy.codes/packages), lists and
summarizes each open-source project.
My aerospace engineering research benefitted greatly from open-source scientific
software. I believe open-source scientific software can similarly benefit the
computational astrophysics research I aspire to undertake as a graduate physics
researcher.
