As a member of the Department of Astronomy at Harvard University, I
would work to ensure all students feel personally and academically
supported. I believe my passion for open-access knowledge, open-source
software, and experience organizing events emphasizing diversity would
contribute positively to the department's welcoming research atmosphere.

My graduate aerospace engineering research led me to a welcoming
open-source scientific software community. After presenting at JuliaCon
2021, computational researchers contacted me to collaborate on future
projects, and share new research methodologies. After finding this
community, I have released open-source notes and software packages. Most
of my contributions have taken the form of astrodynamics software
packages, released to Julia's General registry. Overall, I have
published 16 open-source software packages; all are hosted on my GitHub
profile, [`@cadojo`](https://github.com/cadojo). My personal website,
[`loopy.codes`](https://loopy.codes/packages), lists and summarizes each
open-source project. I firmly believe in open-access knowledge, and I
will continue to share my research software (as I am able) to advance
the scientific community's free educational resources.

I have been encouraged to find so many welcoming researchers within the
astronomy community. I am particularly thankful for Astrobites and their
commitment to improve access to education for all students interested in
astronomy. As a graduate student, I will apply to Astrobites and release
open-access notes as I am able to advance accessibility within astronomy
education.

As the Professional & Personal Development Committee Co-lead at NASA's
Johnson Space Center, I helped to organize a panel discussion which
featured several career employees who are members of the LGBTQ+
community. The event's purpose was to connect early-career employees
with experienced employees, and expose new employees to the past and
present experiences of the LGBTQ+ community within the aerospace
industry. At Harvard University, I would seek out similar opportunities
to share diverse perspectives and expose students to each others' lived
experiences.

The astronomy community is strengthened by its diversity. As a
computational astrophysics researcher, I will continue to emphasize
accessibility in my work and seek out new opportunities to learn from
and support marginalized communities within scientific fields.
